- Added Architecture Decision Record (ADR-004) for single-field union types design

## [0.10.1] - 2025-07-20

### Added
- **Clear Configuration Error Messages** (#34) - Better error handling when language model is not configured
  - New `DSPy::ConfigurationError` exception with actionable error messages
  - Early validation in instrumentation helpers prevents cryptic nil errors
  - Error messages include examples for both global and module-level configuration
  - Comprehensive test coverage for configuration error scenarios

- **Ruby-OpenAI Gem Conflict Detection** (#29) - Warning system for gem conflicts
  - Detects when community `ruby-openai` gem is loaded alongside DSPy
  - Shows clear warning with migration guidance to official OpenAI SDK
  - Helps prevent namespace conflicts and unexpected behavior
  - Includes detection logic that distinguishes between official and community gems

### Documentation

## [0.10.0] - 2025-07-20

### Added
- **Automatic Hash-to-Struct Type Conversion** (#42) - DSPy::Prediction now automatically converts LLM JSON responses to proper Ruby types
  - Enum values: String responses automatically converted to T::Enum instances
  - Nested structs: Hash responses recursively converted to T::Struct objects
  - Arrays: Elements converted based on their declared types
  - Default values: Missing fields use struct defaults
  - Discriminated unions: Smart type selection based on discriminator fields (String or T::Enum)
  - Graceful fallback: Original hash preserved if conversion fails

### Features
- **Union Type Support with T.any()** - Clean handling of multiple possible types
  - Automatic struct selection for discriminated unions
  - Support for T::Enum discriminators (recommended pattern)
  - Array elements with union types converted correctly
  - Deep nesting support (3+ levels with performance considerations)

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive "Automatic Type Conversion" section to complex types documentation
- Updated signatures documentation to highlight automatic conversion feature
- Created blog post "Union Types: The Secret to Cleaner AI Agent Workflows" demonstrating the pattern
- Established Architecture Decision Records (ADR) directory for design decisions

### Infrastructure
- Fixed GitHub Actions to generate OG images in production builds (GENERATE_OG_IMAGES=true)
- Added comprehensive edge case tests for DSPy::Prediction type conversion

### Fixed
- Unicode characters now display correctly in Example#to_s output (e.g., "รท" instead of "\u00F7")

## [0.9.1] - 2025-07-16

### Fixed
- **ReAct Agent Input Flexibility** (#41) - Fixed bug where ReAct agents failed with non-string first inputs or array inputs
  - Removed hardcoded assumption that first input field is always a String "question"
  - ReAct now serializes all input fields as JSON and passes as `input_context` to LLM
  - Supports array inputs, non-string first inputs, and signatures with no string fields
  - Updated internal signatures to use generic `input_context` instead of specific `question` field
  - Added comprehensive integration tests for edge cases

### Added
- **Enhanced ReAct Input Handling** - ReAct agents now work with any input signature structure
  - Array inputs: `const :tasks, T::Array[Task]`
  - Non-string first inputs: `const :number, Integer`
  - Complex nested structures and arbitrary field combinations
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing ReAct agents

### Documentation
- Verified documentation already correctly showed ReAct flexibility
- No documentation updates needed - implementation now matches documented behavior

## [0.9.0] - 2025-07-11

### Breaking Changes
- **Strategy Configuration API** - Simplified strategy configuration using type-safe enums
  - Replaced complex strategy name strings with `DSPy::Strategy::Strict` and `DSPy::Strategy::Compatible` enum values
  - `DSPy::Strategy::Strict` selects provider-optimized strategies (OpenAI structured outputs, Anthropic extraction)
  - `DSPy::Strategy::Compatible` uses enhanced prompting that works with any provider
  - **BREAKING**: String strategy names like `"enhanced_prompting"` are no longer supported
  - **Migration**: Replace `config.structured_outputs.strategy = "enhanced_prompting"` with `config.structured_outputs.strategy = DSPy::Strategy::Compatible`

### Added
- **User-Friendly Strategy Categories** - Two clear strategy options instead of three internal implementations
  - Automatic fallback from Strict to Compatible when provider-specific features are unavailable
  - Type-safe enum values with Sorbet integration
  - Clearer documentation and error messages

### Documentation
- Updated all documentation to use new enum-based strategy configuration
- Improved blog post with correct version references and enum examples
- Clarified strategy selection behavior and fallback logic
