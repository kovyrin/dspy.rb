# DSPy.rb Documentation Site Plan

*Building engaging documentation that actually helps people*

## Overview

Ever tried reading gem documentation that's either too basic or completely 
overwhelming? This plan aims to create something different - documentation that 
feels like pair programming with someone who's actually built this stuff.

The goal: Make DSPy.rb approachable while showcasing the sophisticated 
architecture underneath. Think less "API reference" and more "here's how to 
actually build things."

## Site Structure & Content

### **Getting Started**
*"Your first Ruby AI agent in 10 minutes"*

Ever tried building LLM apps and ended up wrestling with prompt strings? Been 
there. This guide shows you a different approach - one that actually works.

**Pages:**
- `getting-started/index.md` - Why string prompts break
- `getting-started/installation.md` - Setup from scratch  
- `getting-started/first-example.md` - Working code in minutes
- `getting-started/adding-types.md` - Sorbet integration

### **The Basics**
*"Building blocks that actually make sense"*

Nothing fancy here. Just the core pieces you'll use everywhere:

**Signatures**
- `basics/signatures.md` - Define what goes in, what comes out
- `basics/validation.md` - How validation saves your sanity
- `basics/json-schemas.md` - Auto-generated schemas

**Predict**

- `roadmap/persistence.md` - Saving optimized models
- `roadmap/contributing.md` - How to help

## Technical Implementation

### **Bridgetown Setup**

**Gemfile** (docs directory):
```ruby
gem "bridgetown", "~> 1.3"
gem "bridgetown-view-helpers"
gem "rouge" # Syntax highlighting
gem "redcarpet" # Markdown processing
```

**Configuration** (`bridgetown.config.rb`):
```ruby
# Bridgetown configuration for DSPy.rb docs
url: "https://docs.dspy.rb" # or wherever you'll host
title: "DSPy.rb Documentation"
description: "Build reliable LLM applications in Ruby"

# Plugin configuration
plugins_dir: "_plugins"
collections_dir: "src/_collections"

# Syntax highlighting
highlighter: rouge
markdown: redcarpet

# SEO and meta
twitter:
  username: vicentereig
```

### **Site Architecture**

**Layout Structure:**
- `_layouts/default.html` - Base layout with navigation
- `_layouts/docs.html` - Documentation pages with sidebar
- `_layouts/example.html` - Code-heavy examples

**Components:**
- `_components/code_block.rb` - Syntax-highlighted code
- `_components/example_runner.rb` - Interactive examples
- `_components/navigation.rb` - Smart sidebar navigation
- `_components/search.rb` - Documentation search

**Data Sources:**
- `_data/navigation.yml` - Site navigation structure
- `_data/examples.yml` - Code examples metadata
- `_data/specs.yml` - Links to test files

## Content Strategy

### **Writing Style**
- Conversational, honest, practical
- Show working code first, explain concepts second
- Link everything to actual test files
- Include failure scenarios and solutions

### **Code Examples**
Every code example should:
- Be runnable (extracted from specs where possible)
- Show both success and error cases
- Link to the corresponding test file
- Include performance considerations

### **Progressive Complexity**
- Start with simple, working examples
- Build complexity gradually
- Cross-reference related concepts
- Provide "next steps" suggestions

---

*This plan focuses on creating documentation that developers actually want to 
read - practical, honest, and backed by comprehensive testing. The goal is to 
showcase DSPy.rb's sophistication while keeping it approachable.*

## Next Steps

1. Set up basic Bridgetown structure in `docs/`
2. Extract compelling examples from the test suite
3. Create the first few pages to establish tone and structure
4. Get feedback from early users
5. Iterate based on what people actually need

The 226+ tests you've written are the secret weapon here - they prove everything 
works and provide endless material for real-world examples.
