# Improve documentation, add blog section, and fix critical issues for v0.7.0

## Overview

Following a comprehensive analysis of DSPy.rb, this issue tracks improvements needed for the v0.7.0 release. The focus is on better documentation, adding a blog section, fixing critical issues, and improving the overall developer experience.

## Gap Analysis Summary

Our analysis identified several areas for improvement:

### Current Strengths âœ…
- Strong test coverage (54 test files, 2,383 test cases)
- Excellent production features (OpenTelemetry, New Relic, Langfuse)
- Unique CodeAct module for dynamic code generation
- Well-structured architecture with dry-rb gems

### Key Gaps ðŸ”´
1. **Documentation gaps**:
   - CodeAct module lacks detailed documentation
   - Few Ruby-idiomatic examples
   - No blog/tutorial section
   - Missing Rails integration guides

2. **Open issues affecting developer experience**:
   - #32: Default values not working
   - #30: Enum handling confusion in Rails
   - #27: API key validation happens too late

3. **Missing features** (for future releases):
   - Core modules: ProgramOfThought, MultiChainComparison
   - Optimizers: BootstrapFewShot, COPRO
   - Retriever integrations: ChromaDB, Pinecone

- All three critical issues are fixed with tests
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Positive community feedback on improvements

## Timeline

Target completion: 2 weeks

- Week 1: Documentation, blog setup, and issue fixes

## Notes

This release focuses on developer experience and documentation rather than new features. The goal is to make DSPy.rb more approachable and production-ready while setting up infrastructure (blog) for ongoing community engagement.

Future releases will focus on feature parity with Python DSPy (BootstrapFewShot, ProgramOfThought, retriever integrations).
