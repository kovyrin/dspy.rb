# DSPy.rb Documentation Plan

*A framework for building intelligent applications—and becoming a more thoughtful developer*

## What This Is Really About

Ever wondered what it means to write software that thinks?

I'm not talking about importing an LLM library and hoping for the best. I'm talking about how we ought to be approaching AI development as craftspeople. How should we architect systems that reason? Handle uncertainty? Compose complex behaviors from simple parts?

With traditional software it's familiar. We have patterns, frameworks, and mental models that guide us through complexity. We know what good code looks like.

But what about AI applications? For most of us, LLM development just happens. We don't have a framework for intelligent software development that can help us understand where we are and where we want to be.

This is where DSPy.rb comes in.

## The Developmental Approach to AI Programming

Much like Robert Kegan's theory of adult development, AI programming has distinct stages that developers move through. Most of us start with prompt engineering (like children learning through imitation) and gradually develop more sophisticated approaches to building intelligent systems.

The transformation isn't about learning more prompt tricks—it's about fundamentally changing how we think about AI systems. It's a "Subject-Object Shift" where what once controlled us (fragile prompts, unpredictable outputs) becomes something we can examine, understand, and direct.

### **Where Are You in Your AI Development Journey?**

Most developers I meet are at one of these stages:

**Stage 1: The Prompt Crafter** 
- Everything feels like string manipulation
- Success seems random and unreproducible  
- "I AM someone who writes prompts"

**Stage 2: The Template Builder**
- Adding structure through templates
- Starting to separate concerns
- "I HAVE prompt templates I can modify"

**Stage 3: The Framework User** (most AI developers)
- Using libraries without deep understanding
- Copy-pasting examples
- "I HAVE tools, but they control my thinking"

**Stage 4: The Structured Programmer** 
- Building from composable, typed modules
- Systems that introspect and adapt
- "I HAVE an approach to AI architecture"

**Stage 5: The AI Architect**
- Designing systems that optimize themselves
- Understanding intelligence patterns
- "I HAVE principles that guide AI system design"

Which stage resonates with where you are now? Where would you like to be?

## Writing Style & Approach

**Inspired by Kegan's Developmental Theory**

Every piece of documentation follows these principles:

1. **Start with introspective questions** - Meet readers in their current reality
2. **Acknowledge where most of us are** - Create connection through shared struggle  
3. **Present transformation, not just information** - Focus on changing how we think
4. **Provide developmental stages** - Help readers locate themselves and see growth paths
5. **Encourage self-examination** - Include reflection prompts and exercises
6. **Use concrete examples** - Abstract concepts grounded in real code
7. **Maintain humble expertise** - Share what we've learned while acknowledging complexity

### **Content Patterns**

Each major section includes:
- **Reflection questions** to help examine current approach
- **Transformation exercises** to shift perspective
- **Working examples** from our 226+ test suite  
- **Growth paths** showing next steps in development

### **Code as Conversation**

Every code example sparks questions:
- What assumptions is this making?
- How does this handle uncertainty?
- What would happen if I changed this?
- How does this relate to how I think about problems?

## Technical Implementation

### **Bridgetown Setup**

The site will be built with Bridgetown, focusing on:
- **Progressive enhancement** - Works for everyone, enhanced for some
- **Thoughtful navigation** - Guides developmental journey
- **Interactive examples** - Learn by doing, not just reading
- **Community features** - Discussion and contribution

### **Directory Structure** (see below)

### **Resource Integration**
- Link every concept to working tests
- Extract examples from comprehensive spec suite
- Show both success and failure scenarios
- Connect to broader AI development community

## Success Redefined

**Developer Transformation:**
- Shift from "trial and error" to systematic thinking
- Increased confidence in AI system design
- Community contributions showing deep understanding

**System Quality:**
- Reliable, tested AI applications
- Production systems that actually work
